WJoy Unity Integration (for Unity5)
Instructions:
1. Build and run target WiimoteSocketApp in WJoy Xcodeproject.
2. Hit sync on wiimote, then press button "Find Wiimote" in WiimoteSocketApp
3. Run Unity project TestScene scene, then press "Connect Unity" in WiimoteSocketApp
4. If Wii Motionplus is connected, hold the wiimote still until the message "calibrated" appears in Unity console

The Unity integration currently works through TCP sockets, passing json messages.
If Wii Motionplus is connected and the wiimote is calibrated (in the Unity game), the approximate rotation is calculated. This is drift-corrected from gyroscope values and when IR Values are centered.
IR Values are visualized as red numbers, corresponding with the packet slot the tracked point is in.

It should be pretty easy to implement an IR Pointing algorithm based off the data.
